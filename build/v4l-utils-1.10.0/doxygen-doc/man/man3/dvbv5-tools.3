dvbv5-tools \- DVBv5 Tools 
Set of DVBv5 tools, bundled together with libdvbv5
.PP
DVBv5 Tools is a small set of command line utilities that was developed to be compliant with the newer features provided by version 5 of the DVB API\&. The tools should also be backward compatible with the older v3 DVB API\&. They were written using libdvbv5\&.
.PP
It is composed of 4 tools:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
dvbv5-scan - Scans the channel transponders and gets the services available there;
.IP "\(bu" 2
dvbv5-zap - Locks into a channel (zap), allowing other applications to get the stream at the dvr devices or to monitor the stream;
.IP "\(bu" 2
dvb-fe-tool - Lists frontend properties and allow to manually set the DVB frontend
.IP "\(bu" 2
dvb-format-convert - Converts from/to other formats used by DVBv3 apps into the dvbv5 format\&.
.PP
.PP
The DVBv5 default file format is formed by a channel name, followed by a series of key/value properties\&. Those tools also support the legacy formats used by dvb-apps\&.
.PP
For example, this is a channel file with one DVB-C channel on it: 
.PP
.nf
1 [CHANNEL]
2         DELIVERY_SYSTEM = DVBC/ANNEX_A
3         FREQUENCY = 573000000
4         SYMBOL_RATE = 5217000
5         INNER_FEC = NONE
6         MODULATION = QAM/256
7         INVERSION = AUTO

.fi
.PP
 And this is (part of) a service (zap) file, produced from the above channel definition using dvbv5-scan:
.PP
.PP
.nf
1 [SBT]
2         SERVICE_ID = 4
3         VIDEO_PID = 42
4         AUDIO_PID = 257
5         PID_f1 = 768
6         FREQUENCY = 573000000
7         MODULATION = QAM/256
8         INVERSION = AUTO
9         SYMBOL_RATE = 5217000
10         INNER_FEC = NONE
11         DELIVERY_SYSTEM = DVBC/ANNEX_A
12 
13 [TNT]
14         SERVICE_ID = 48
15         VIDEO_PID = 336
16         AUDIO_PID = 337 338 849
17         PID_86 = 816
18         FREQUENCY = 573000000
19         MODULATION = QAM/256
20         INVERSION = AUTO
21         SYMBOL_RATE = 5217000
22         INNER_FEC = NONE
23         DELIVERY_SYSTEM = DVBC/ANNEX_A
